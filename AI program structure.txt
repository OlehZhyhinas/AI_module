AI program structure:

Data Module: module for working with various data that is available to AI
	Communcations Class: communicates with server
		-> recieves movement results from data store, and retrieves next move data from 
		   data store
	Data Store: stores map data, movement history, results ect
		-> take data from communications other classes and store it, and provide next
		   move on request

Decision Module:
	prediction class: predict future events (map changes, other actors' movements, ect)
		-> takes data from data store and makes predictions, sends predictions to data store
	evaluation class: evaluate possible movements
		-> take data from data store and evaluate moves, save move result predictions
		   and next move in data store
	

Training Module:
	results class: deterimine result of actions
		-> take data from data store and identify success or failure of actions, return results to data store
	modification class: modify AI parameters based on results
		-> take results from data store and modify some evaluation and prediction class parameters
